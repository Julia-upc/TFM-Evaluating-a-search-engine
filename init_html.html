<h2>EVALUATING A SEARCH ENGINE</h2>

<p>Here will be the explanation of what the user will have to do as well as a brief description of the tasks.</p>

<p>We will also mention that in the next page there will be a questionnaire and
after they send the questionnaire the first timed task will start.</p>

<p>Also explain how a little how the search engines work. For example, to go back and forth in Pubmed, you only need to click the explorer arrows. If you are on full screen mode you need to leave it to go back and forth.</p>

<p> This is the change I have made </p>
