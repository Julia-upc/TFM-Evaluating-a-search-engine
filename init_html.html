<h2>EVALUATING A SEARCH ENGINE</h2>

On this page will be the explanation of what the user will have to do as well as a brief description of the tasks. <br><br>
We will also mention that on the next page there will be a survey and after they submit the survey the first timed task will start.<br><br>
In addition, we will explain a little how the search engines work. For example, to go back and forth in Pubmed, you just need to click the arrows in the browser in non-full screen mode or use the keyboard shortcut Alt+ (Left Arrow).<br><br>
